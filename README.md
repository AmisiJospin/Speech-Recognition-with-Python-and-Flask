# Speech-Recognition-with-Python-and-Flask
This project is a beginner-friendly Python and Flask application focused on building a platform to analyze and transcribe any Audio File uploaded to the website. I use the SpeechRecognition module in Python, take an Audio File as input in Flask, create both a GET and POST request on the same route and finally render the transcribed results of the speech file to the user.

# Two libraries were added on this project namely Flask and SpeechRecognition
